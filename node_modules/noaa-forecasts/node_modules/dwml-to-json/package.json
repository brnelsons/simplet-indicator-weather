  "readme": "# dwml-to-json\nPass in a DWML string, get back a JS object.\n\nThis is a fairly naive approach to making [DWML](http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/mdl/XML/Design/MDL_XML_Design.pdf) more approachable in JS.\n\n### Installation\n\n    npm install dwml-to-json\n    \n### Example usage\n\n    var fs = require('fs');\n    var parser = require('dwml-to-json');\n    var xmlString = fs.readFileSync('path/to/dwml-file', 'utf8');\n    var parsedData = dwmlParser.parse(xmlString);\n\n### What does the JSON look like?\nLook at the test file `test/visual-example.js` to see what the JSON looks like.\nThat JSON is based on the DWML found in `test/dwml.xml`\n\n### Completeness\nSo far I've only tested `precipitation` and `probability-of-precipitation` as those were the only parameters I needed. \n\nBut you should be able to include any location-based parameters in your DWML document and recieve them in the JSON response.\n \n### Contributing\nPlease contribute.  There were no dwml parsers when I wrote this, so I'd love it if we could all get behind one in the npm community.\n\nObviously you can fork this, etc, but the better this tool gets the more we all profit.",
